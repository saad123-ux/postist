### Configuration uses environment variables

The docker containers for Postiz are entirely configured with environment variables.

- **Option A** - environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file
- **Option B** - environment variables in a `postiz.env` file mounted in `/config` for the Postiz container only
- **Option C** - environment variables in a `.env` file next to your `docker-compose.yml` file (not recommended).

... or a mixture of the above options!

There is a [configuration reference](https://docs.postiz.com/configuration/reference) page with a list
of configuration settings.

Setup:
```
git clone https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-docker-compose
```

Then run:
```
docker compose up
```
